# leaflet-challenge

This repository contains the html, css and javascript for the leaflet challenge.

The website has been deployed at: https://mford80.github.io/leaflet-challenge/

This website provides visualisation for all earthquakes from the past 7 days, with the data taken from: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

This website provides all the functionality required in Leaflet Part 1 of the challenge. In addition it has the capacity to change the basemap and add/remove the Earthquake layer as required in Leaflet Part 2.

Note that all the code for the Part 1 and 2 requirements have been combined into the same javascript file (ie. the 'logic.js' file). Note also that while the challenge was largely addressed using javascript, the provided css and html files have also been edited.
